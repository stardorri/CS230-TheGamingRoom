# CS 230 – The Gaming Room Software Design Document

## Client Summary
The Gaming Room wanted to expand their Android game *Draw It or Lose It* into a web-based, multi-platform version. The client needed a secure, scalable architecture that supported multiple players, teams, and real-time gameplay across devices.

## What I Did Well
I explained the system architecture and operating platform clearly and connected it to real-world deployment. I also tied each design choice back to the client’s needs, which made the document organized and realistic.

## What I Found Helpful
Breaking down the design document over several projects helped me understand the importance of planning software before development. It made me think about how systems interact at a deeper level—memory, networking, storage, and security.

## What I Would Revise
If I could revise something, I’d simplify some of the more technical sections so non-technical clients could understand them more easily. I’d also add visuals, like diagrams, to make the architecture clearer.

## Understanding User Needs
The Gaming Room’s main need was scalability and security for multi-platform play. I reflected that by recommending Linux servers, containerization, and secure communication protocols. Understanding user needs ensures that the design actually solves their problems, not just meets technical specs.

## My Design Approach
I used a structured approach—define the requirements, evaluate possible platforms, then make recommendations. I plan to use this same approach in future software projects, adding more visual aids and prototypes to communicate design ideas effectively.
